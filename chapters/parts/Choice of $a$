Choice of $a$

\section{Choice of $a$}

The choice of the second coefficient $a$ directly affects the performance characteristics of reduction algorithms. Several factors are at play:

If $m-a < W$ software implementations will be less efficient. This is because there will be XOR operations inside words, and the operations can not be performed with full word-sized XORs.

The alignment of $a$ and $m-a$ with relation to $W$ define if word-sized XORs will require bits of two words in the source or in the destination. Thus alignment can halve the number of operations involved.
