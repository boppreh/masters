Difficulty


The difficulty of the conversion process greatly varies depending on the
access pattern of the algorithm and alignment of words. If all coefficients inside a range are
XOR'ed once in a linear fashion, the XOR distance a multiple of the word size, and the start and end range lie in word boundaries, the converted algorithm gains a full
speedup of up to \texttt{WORD\_SIZE} times
{[}$C_{word} = \ceil*{\frac{C_{bit}}{W}}${]}.
