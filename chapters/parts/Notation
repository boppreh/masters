Notation

\subsection{Notations}
In this paper, we assume that one word has $W$ bits where $W$ is a multiple of $8$. The bits of a word $A$ are numbered from $0$ to $W-1$, with the rightmost bit (LSB) of $A$ designated as bit $0$. The following standard notation is used to denote operations on words $A$ and $B$:\\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $A \BitXOR B$ & bitwise exclusive or. \\
  $A \BitOr B$ & bitwise or. \\
  $A \BitAnd B$     & bitwise $AND$. \\ 
  $A \ShiftLeft n$     & left shift of $A$ by $n$ positions, ($n<W$), with the bits from 0 to $n-1$ set to $0$. \\
  $A\ShiftRight n$    & righ shift of $A$ by $n$ positions, ($n<W$), with bits from $W-n$ to $W-1$ set to $0$. \\
  $C$ & Vector os bits.\\
  $D$ & Array de elements of $W$ bits. \\
  $D_{Red}$ & Reduced element. \\
\end{tabular}\\

Figure~\ref{fig:elemento:field} shows the representation of a element $d \in \ftwom$ as an array $D$ of $t$ words of $W$ bits, where $t = \left \lceil \frac{m}{W} \right \rceil$. The $s = tW-m$ highest order bits of $D[t-1]$ are not unused.

For the case where $(m-1) \mod{W} > \frac{W}{2}$, the Figure~\ref{fig:elemento:field:mult} shows the representation of a element $d = ab$, $a,b \in \ftwom$ as an array $D$ of $W$-bit words. The $s = 2(tW-m)+1$ highest order bits of $D[2t-1]$ are not unused.

\end{figure}


When $(m-1) \mod{W} \leq \frac{W}{2}$, $D[2t-1]$ is not needed.  Figure~\ref{fig:elemento:field:mult2} shows the representation of a element $d = ab$, $a,b \in \ftwom$ as an array $D$ of $W$-bit words. The $s = 2(tW-m)+1$ highest order bits of $D[2t-2]$ and $D[2t-1]$ are not unused.

In these cases a whole word is wasted, but length calculations become simpler: to get the length (in words) of a product of two elements, just add their lengths (in words).
