Finite field arithmetic is the fundamental for many important cryptosystems, such as ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Such arithmetic is often implemented by performing operations on integers or polynomials, then performing modular reduction on the result. The usage of binary polynomials is specially common for hardware implementations, as the operations map well to logic gates.

The performance of such system is important because it maps directly to fabrication costs, circuit area, power consumption, and execution time. Since finite field arithmetic is the basis of various cryptosystems, any optimizations in this area will cause improvements in the general system. Such improvements are specially useful for constrained systems, such as sensor networks.

This work has two general objectives. First, to act as an introduction to finite field arithmetic, and how fields based on binary polynomials are used in practice, down to the logic gates. It is our hope that this introduction can help future researchers that wish to understand or improve this area.

Our second general objective is to propose improvements on finite field arithmetic, with the goal of having these low level improvements leading to improvements in the overall system. Specifically, reducing the delay and number of logic gates required for reduction and squaring in binary finite fields; generalizing these improvements to other finite fields implemented with polynomials; and finally, translating these low level improvements to software algorithms.

Our work was motivated by the international cooperation between our Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, and the Canadian Carleton University. This cooperation produced many projects related to fast processing in finite fields, specifically for cryptographic systems. This choice of subject was the result of a general dissatisfaction of the speed of the high level systems. The approach of optimizing the low level components was seen as a natural consequence of the expertise brought by this cooperation.

In Chapter~\label{cap:background} we introduce the basic mathematics behind finite field, with a goal of both introducing the subject for interested researchers, and to give the necessary background for the subsequent chapters. We focus on reduction and exponentiation of binary polynomials, and propose new hardware algorithms in Chapter~\ref{chapters/reduction_squaring_2}. In Chapter~\ref{chapters/word_processing} we contextualize and provide tools on how to translate hardware algorithms in a way to also be efficient in software. Chapter~\ref{chapters/visual_debugger} showscases the visualization tools we developed to help this research. Chapter~\ref{chapters/final_considerations} contains our final considerations, giving a conclusion and raising interesting future works.
